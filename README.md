A primitive nonogram solver; a solution to this reddit challenge: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/42x90t/20160127_challenge_251_hard_solve_a_nonogram_bonus/

It successfully solves the challenge examples (in `inputs/{1,2,3}.txt`) but is
too slow to solve the example from wikipedia (in `inputs/4.txt`).

Note: this is a Netbeans project; no Makefile is provided.
